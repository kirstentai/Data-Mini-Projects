## Health Analytics case study: help the team answer business questions
## through debugging their SQL code

### Summary of questions:
1. How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
3. What about the median number of measurements per user?
4. How many users have 3 or more measurements?
5. How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?

Looking at the logs data - what is the number and percentage of the active user base who:

6. Have logged blood glucose measurements?
7. Have at least 2 types of measurements?
8. Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

For users that have blood pressure measurements:

9. What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?

### Debugged queries
-- 1. How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
SELECT
 count (distinct id) as user_id
FROM health.user_logs
limit 10;

-- for questions 2-8 we created a temporary table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count as
(SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS measure_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT measure) as unique_measures
  FROM health.user_logs
  GROUP BY 1);

-- 2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(measure_count)) as average_measure
FROM user_measure_count;

-- 3. What about the median number of measurements per user?
SELECT
  ROUND(
  CAST(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY measure_count) as numeric),
  2) AS median_value
FROM user_measure_count;

-- 4. How many users have 3 or more measurements?
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 3;

-- 5. How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?
SELECT
  COUNT(distinct id)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE measure_count >= 1000;

-- 6. Have logged blood glucose measurements?
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure = 'blood_glucose';

-- 7. Have at least 2 types of measurements?
SELECT
  COUNT(distinct id)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures >= 2;


-- 8. Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures = 3;

-- 9.  What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?

SELECT
  cast(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY systolic) as numeric) AS median_systolic,
  cast(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY diastolic) as numeric) AS median_diastolic
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure ='blood_pressure';
