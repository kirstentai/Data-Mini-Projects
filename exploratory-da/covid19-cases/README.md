# An Analysis of COVID-19 Case Counts by Country

Given the countries and the count of positive, hospitalised, recovered, deaths and other variables, this analysis aims to answer the question: Which countries have had the highest number of COVID-19 cases against the number of tests administered?

In this project, I used simple R functions from tidyverse, readr, tibble to analyse which countries have the highest positive cases when compared against number tested.

For summarised findings, see covid19_analysis.html.
