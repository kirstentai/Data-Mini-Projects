# Data Analytics on Hacker News Posts
Key skills: Data analysis in Python focusing on cleaning strings and working with date and time

Hacker News is a site created by Y Combinator, where user-submitted posts are voted and commented upon, similar to Reddit.
We are particularly interested in posts beginning with "Ask HN" and "Show HN". Below are some examples.

Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?

Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?

Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?

Show HN: Wio Link ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'

Show HN: Something pointless I made

The aim of this project is to determine whether these "Ask HN" and "Show HN" posts are more receptive in comments on average
and whether posts created on certain times of the day receive more comments on average.

Using date and time functions in Python, as well as string functions, this project aims to hone my skills in data cleaning and data analysis.
